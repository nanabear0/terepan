# Terepan v1.0

[Start using terepan!](https://nanabear0.github.io/terepan)

## Overview
Terepan allows you to keep upto date on the latest releases from the artist you follow.
It leverages the musicbrainz api, so it is mostly accurate.

## Usage
Use the search page to add your favourite artists.
After you start adding them the page will automatically start updating it's database.
You can see all the latest releases in the latest releases page. (duh)

As the page stores all it's data in the localstorage use the import and export tabs to move your followed artists between browsers. Just export to a file and import it in the import tab.
